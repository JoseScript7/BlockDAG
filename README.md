# RWAChain Project

## Overview
RWAChain is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project that aims to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) on the blockchain. The project includes smart contracts for managing RWAs, a frontend application for user interaction, and backend services for custodianship and data analytics.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- **contracts/**: Contains all smart contracts related to RWAs, including ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, collateral management, yield distribution, and more.
- **frontend/**: A React application that interacts with the smart contracts, providing a user-friendly interface for minting, redeeming, and managing RWAs.
- **backend-services/**: Off-chain services that handle custodianship, data aggregation, monitoring, and yield prediction.
- **analytics/**: Scripts and notebooks for data analysis and machine learning model training.
- **docs/**: Documentation for the project, including architecture, user guides, and API references.
- **infra/**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations for deploying the project on cloud services.
- **tests/**: Integration and end-to-end tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd RWAChain_Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   - For the root project:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - For the contracts:
     ```bash
     cd contracts
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values.

4. **Deploy contracts**:
   - Use the provided scripts in the `contracts/scripts` directory to deploy the contracts to your desired network.

5. **Run the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

6. **Run backend services**:
   - Follow the instructions in the `backend-services/README.md` for setting up and running the backend services.

## Usage
- **Minting RWAs**: Users can mint RWAs through the frontend interface.
- **Redeeming RWAs**: Users can redeem their RWAs for underlying assets.
- **Yield Management**: Users can manage and claim yields generated from their RWAs.
